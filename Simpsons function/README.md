# Integral numerical estimation: Simpsons 1/3 and Trapezoidal rule!

Simpsons function will use mix of simpsons 1/3 composite rule and single application of trapezoidal rule if needed to approximate the integral for given set of inputs and outputs.


# INPUTS:

*       x - array that represents the input
*       y - array that represents the input
*       Note: they have to be the same size
*

# OUTPUTS:
*
*       I - Approximation of an integral.
