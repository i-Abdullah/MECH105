# MECH 105, Colorado State University, Spring 2018


* This repository contains all of my algorithms and codes made by me to solve homework problems in MECH 105, Colorado State University, Spring 2018. Some of them are numerical method tools to approximate solutions for problems.

* Each (or most) of the Files has the corresponding Homework problems.
`All rights reserved for whoever wrote the HW. Dr Samuel Bechara, and CSU`

* Note: most of the codes inside them has enough comments that tills you what the function do and how to use it. USE HELP in MATLAB to find more.

* Feel free to use them and correct them if they have any mistakes!
