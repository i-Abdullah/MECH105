* Abdulla Al Ameri
* Due Date: 30th, April, 2018

* This function will attepmt to solve differential equations using Iterative Heun's method (AKA predictor-corrector).

# INPUTS:


*	dydt(t,y) - anonymous differential equation

* 	tspan - span of t values

*	y0   - Initial condition for x0

*	es   - Stopping criteria: relative error

‘will deafult to 0.001 if user left it empty. ’

*	 maxit- maximum number of iterations

‘ will deafult to 50 if user left it empty. ’


# OUTPUTS:

*	t- set of t values (will start from 0)
*	y- set of y values
*	Plot - Plot for t and y


**Note:** odeSolved PDF is done by Dr. Samuel Bechara, Phd, CSU. It is a reference to the correct method done by Dr. B.
